# handles

`handles` is a templating language in pure Gleam. Heavily inspired by  [mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) and [Handlebars.js](https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js).

```sh
gleam add handles
```

```gleam
import handles

pub fn main() {
  // TODO: An example of the project in use
}
```

Further documentation can be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/handles>.

## Development

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
gleam shell # Run an Erlang shell
```
